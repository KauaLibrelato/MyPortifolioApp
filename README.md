# My Portifolio App

My portfolio is not just a portfolio in itself, but the app where I will use to test and learn new technologies.




## Technologies

- React Native
- Expo
- React Navigation
- Jest
- Styled Components
- i18n
- Eslint
- Prettier
- ...


## Installation

To run my project, it's necessary to have Expo installed on your machine, as well as yarn, and node (+20.0). Also, have Expo Go on your smartphone.

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/KauaLibrelato/MyPortifolioApp.git
```

```bash
  yarn
```

```bash
  yarn start
  - press "S" in the terminal to switch to Expo Go
```

- After that, scan the QR Code that will open on your device.

    
## Running Tests

To run the tests, execute the following command:

```bash
 yarn test
```


## Roadmap

- Use of Firebase for notifications and a "backend" to fetch information.

- Use of React Query + Zustand for API calls.

- Implementation of notifications.
